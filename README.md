Heron
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EmptyStackExn/heron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EmptyStackExn/heron)

> Symbolic Simulation Engine for Timed Causality Models expressed in the [Tagged Events Specification Language (TESL)](http://wwwdi.supelec.fr/software/TESL/)

This prototype solves specifications given in TESL by exploring full counterfactual facts. In particular, it returns classes of runs modulo non-interfering external components. Such classes are modeled in Horn-style Affine Arithmetic, for which we embed a decision procedure.

The project is named after [Heron of Alexandria](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Heron.html), the first century Greek mathematician and engineer.

Getting started
-------------------
We recommend to compile with [MLton](http://mlton.org/) as it provides interesting code optimization features in Standard ML. To build sources, just type
```bash
make
```

Several examples are provided in `examples` directory. To execute one of them, you can simply type
```bash
./heron < examples/gallery/LightSwitch.tesl
```

Example
-------------------
```
int-clock master1 sporadic 1, 4, 7
int-clock master2 sporadic   2, 5
unit-clock slave
tag relation master1 = master2

master1 implies slave
master2 implies slave
```

The TESL tagged event engine will produce the following run:

Our tool is able to explore counterfactual facts and stops whenever a finite satisfying run is found
```
