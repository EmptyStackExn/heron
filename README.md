> A Symbolic Simulation Engine for Timed Causality Models expressed in the [Tagged Events Specification Language (TESL)](http://wwwdi.supelec.fr/software/TESL/)

This prototype solves specifications given in TESL by exploring full counterfactual facts. In particular, it returns classes of runs modulo non-interfering external components. Such classes are modeled by a Horn-style Affine Arithmetic, for which we embed a decision procedure.

Example
-------------------
```
int-clock master1 sporadic 1, 4, 7
int-clock master2 sporadic   2, 5
unit-clock slave
tag relation master1 = master2

master1 implies slave
master2 implies slave
```

The TESL tagged event engine will produce the following run:

Our tool is able explores counterfactual facts all stops wheneven a finite satisfying run is found
```
## Simulation result:
		m1		slave		m2		
[1]		â‡‘ 1		â‡‘		  1
[2]		ðŸ›‡				â‡‘ 2
[3]		â‡‘ 4		â‡‘		  4
[4]		ðŸ›‡				â‡‘ 5
[5]		â‡‘ 7		â‡‘		  7
## End
## Simulation result:
		m1		slave		m2		
[1]		â‡‘ 1		â‡‘		  1
[2]		ðŸ›‡				â‡‘ 2
[3]		â‡‘ 4		â‡‘		  4
[4]		â‡‘ 5		â‡‘		â‡‘ 5
[5]		â‡‘ 7		â‡‘		  7
## End
## Simulation result:
		m1		slave		m2		
[1]		â‡‘ 1		â‡‘		  1
[2]		â‡‘ 2		â‡‘		â‡‘ 2
[3]		â‡‘ 4		â‡‘		  4
[4]		ðŸ›‡				â‡‘ 5
[5]		â‡‘ 7		â‡‘		  7
## End
## Simulation result:

Getting started
-------------------
You can use this tool with different compilers as it is written in Standard ML. It is recommended to use [MLton compiler](http://mlton.org/) as it provides interesting code optimization features. To run the above example in `Examples.sml`, just type
```
make run
```

If you decide to use [Poly/ML](http://www.polyml.org/) instead, you need `polybuild`:
```
mkdir contrib
hg clone --cwd contrib https://bitbucket.org/cannam/sml-buildscripts
```
