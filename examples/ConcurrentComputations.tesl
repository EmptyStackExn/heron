compA sporadic 10
tag relation compA = 1 * CPU1t + 0
compA time delayed by 5 on CPU1t implies Aavail

compB sporadic 20
tag relation compB = 1 * CPU2t + 0
compB time delayed by 15 on CPU2t implies Bavail

Aav sustained immediately from Bavail to compAB implies compAB
Bav sustained immediately from Aavail to compAB implies compAB
 
compAB time delayed by 10 on CPU1t implies ABavail
