// HandWatch
// Exhaustive policy

// The following example depicts two clocks: `sec` and `min`
// respectively denote time in different scales; `move` occurs whenever
// the hand of a watch has moved.

rational-clock sec
rational-clock min sporadic 0.0
unit-clock move
tag relation sec = 60.0 * min
min implies move
min time delayed by 1.0 on min implies min
