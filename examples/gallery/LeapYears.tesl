year periodic 1 // count years
 
year4 periodic 4 // build a clock with period 4 on the same time same as year
tag relation year4 = 1 * year + 0
 
year100 periodic 100 // build a clock with period 100 on the same time same as year
tag relation year100 = 1 * year + 0
 
year400 periodic 400 // build a clock with period 400 on the same time same as year
tag relation year400 = 1 * year + 0
 
// A year is leap if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100
year4 when not year100 implies leap
// However, a year divisible by 400 is leap
year400 implies leap
